# ParaPDF runtime prototype: scripted scroll, WebKit 27.2

- Run at: 2026-10-24T09:11:01.854Z
- Machine: darwin 27.0.0 arm64, Apple M2 Pro (12 logical cores); WebKit 27.2 (Playwright build, headless); power: AC; one-minute load average 3.3 at the start, 4.5 at the end; waited once (1 min in all) for other Playwright browsers or a load average above 5 and repeated 0 jobs that another browser overlapped
- Idle baseline (calibrate.html, median of jobs): 4 ms timer late by 4.0 ms (median) / 5.6 ms (p95); animation frames every 16.7 ms.
- Method: 1280×900 viewport at devicePixelRatio 2, fit-width zoom, vertical scroll mode, 4000 ms of scrolling at a constant speed in CSS pixels per second after the first page is painted, sideways in horizontal mode and downward otherwise, median of 3 runs. Variants named "before" ran on main before M2 (a947f02), each in turn with its twin, job by job.
- First paint: time from navigation start until page 1 shows pixels.
- Blank: share of the viewport covered by pages without pixels, averaged over frames; blank frames: frames where more than 1% was blank.
- Main thread: summed lateness of a 4 ms timer while scrolling, beyond 2 ms or the idle page's 95th percentile, whichever is larger, plus the raw p95 and maximum lateness.
- Dropped frames: animation frames longer than 1.5 idle frame intervals.
- React commits: commits of the viewer's React tree while scrolling, and per second. Store updates: how often the store published while scrolling, and how often that moved the mounted window and the current page, the changes that should make React commit.
- Reproduce: `pnpm --filter @parapdf/prototype build && BROWSER=webkit VARIANTS=pdfjs-hwa RUNS=3 OUTPUT=scroll-m2-webkit pnpm --filter @parapdf/prototype bench`
