# ParaPDF runtime prototype: scripted scroll, Firefox 159.0

- Run at: 2026-11-13T01:57:06.643Z
- Machine: darwin 27.2.0 arm64, Apple M2 Pro (12 logical cores); Firefox 159.0 (Playwright build, headless); power: AC; one-minute load average 8.7 at the start, 4.9 at the end; waited 0 times (0 min in all) for other Playwright browsers and repeated 0 jobs that another browser overlapped
- Idle baseline (calibrate.html, median of jobs): 4 ms timer late by 0.1 ms (median) / 0.1 ms (p95); animation frames every 16.7 ms.
- Method: 1280×900 viewport at devicePixelRatio 2, fit-width zoom, vertical scroll mode, 4000 ms of scrolling at a constant speed in CSS pixels per second after the first page is painted, sideways in horizontal mode and downward otherwise, median of 7 runs. Variants named "before" ran on main b279827, each in turn with its twin, job by job.
- First paint: time from navigation start until page 1 shows pixels, the median of the runs. Each run's is listed under its table: a page shows on an animation frame, so the median moves by a whole frame when one run in a few changes frames.
- Blank: share of the viewport covered by pages without pixels, averaged over frames; blank frames: frames where more than 1% was blank.
- Main thread: summed lateness of a 4 ms timer while scrolling, beyond 2 ms or the idle page's 95th percentile, whichever is larger, plus the raw p95 and maximum lateness.
- Dropped frames: animation frames longer than 1.5 idle frame intervals.
- Canvas memory: the pixels of the canvases in the page and of those kept for pages that unmounted, at 4 bytes each, once the pages settled after scrolling.
- Versions: pdfjs-dist 6.5.438.
- React commits: commits of the viewer's React tree while scrolling, and per second. Store updates: how often the store published while scrolling, and how often that moved the mounted window and the current page, the changes that should make React commit.
